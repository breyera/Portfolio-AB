# Portfolio-AB

## This Repository

In this project, I was tasked with building a portfolio site, from scratch, to help potential clients and/or rectuiters learn more about me and my experiences. An about me, projects, and contact section allow viewers to learn more about who I am and what I do, what I've worked on, and how to get in touch. I also included links to social media as another way to learn more - for now, only links to Github and LinkedIn are active.

In order for people with different screen sizes to view the site, I added a mobile view CSS sheet for responsiveness. I also used flexbox and css grid to format the site, both for desktop and for mobile.

As I learn JavaScript, I hope to update this site to make the mobile view easier - such as adding a hamburger menu for the navigation.
